## henesys

`WIP ðŸš§`
`Dec 2022â€“`
`code`
`design`

A barebones bookmarking, capture-anything site, inspired by the likes of [Are.na](https://are.na) and [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com). Simple and streamlined, save files, images, URLs or plaintext for future reference. Add notes or tags if you'd like. That's it.

Just a small experiment and exploration of mine. Feel free to check it out [here](https://henesys.online).
