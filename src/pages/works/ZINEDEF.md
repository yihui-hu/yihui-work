## ZINEDEF

`2019–2021`

ZINEDEF[^1] is a 60-page zine documenting the moments, experiences, stories, and everything in between that I accumulated during my time in the army. 

Saddle-stitched with military provisions and printed on standard copier paper, I worked on it on and off for about two years—the duration of mandatory military service in the Singapore Armed Forces.  

Below are some sample spreads from the project[^2]:

[^1]: Portmanteau of zine and MINDEF (Ministry of Defence Singapore).
[^2]: I previously made a small batch of 20 zines and sold it to friends for charity. I don't plan to make any more physical copies, but if you'd like a digital copy of ZINEDEF, please reach out to me via yyihui.hu (at) gmail (dot) com. I'd be more than happy to share a copy with you.
