<br />

In the process of swapping Sketch for Figma in my workflow, I decided to recreate and refine the [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) iOS app as a small practice, with cues taken from the likes of [Oku](https://oku.club) and [Literal](https://literal.club).

<br />

Goals:

1. Simplify and modularise components for better design coherence
2. Tweak social elements to make reading and sharing more fruitful
3. Make finding / browsing books more enjoyable
