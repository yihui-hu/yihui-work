## pokéSearch

`Jun 2022`
`code`

Built over a week during summer break in 2022, pokéSearch is a minimalist Pokédex that displays key information and trivia about a certain Pokémon / species, without the cruft of other popular encyclopedias like Bulbapedia or Serebii.

It pulls in data from the publicly available [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and was my first project[^1] completed in [React](https://react.dev/). It's not the most polished or performant, but I'm still proud of it. View the project [here](https://pokesearch-simple.netlify.app).
