## Graphite Reproductions

`2017â€“`
`art`

<br />

A collection of reproductions of paintings I like from the Renaissance and Romantic periods (I think), done in graphite.

<br/>

In order of appearance:
1. Allegory of Peace and War by Pompeo Batoni (2021)
2. Still Life with Flowers by Rachel Ruysch (2021)
3. Mercy Otis Warren by John Singleton Copley (2020)
4. Louise Queen of Belgians by Franz Xaver Winterhalter (2017)
