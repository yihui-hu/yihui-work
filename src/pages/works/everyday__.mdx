A body of 9 artworks, completed over the course of two years for the [International Baccalaureate Higher Level Visual Arts program](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/the-arts/visual-arts/). 

More than anything, it was an excuse for me to, as best I could, experiment with new mediums. Thermal paper, soap, and found objects coloured this period of my life, alongside many late nights ideating, researching, and making. 

I don't create as much art nowadays, but I follow essentially the same practice when coding.

I can't say I remember exactly what I was trying to achieve with this body of work. And honestly, reading the old curatorial rationale now, I'm not sure I knew back then either. But I feel the last line from the rationale sums up the exhibition well enough:

> *...rather, the emphasis is on how anyone is able to use, transform and manipulate any given [medium, style, subject matter, etc.] to grant old narratives new meaning. The exhibition therefore implores the audience to similarly find and reinvigorate their own sense of curiosity within their own lives, which I find important in our increasingly hustle-and-bustle society.*
