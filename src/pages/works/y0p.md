## y0p

`NEW ðŸŒ€`
`May 2023`
`code`

Pushing the boundaries of human communication on the web through highlighting text.

Don't read too much into it and just [have fun](https://y0p.vercel.app) :0) or view the [source code](https://github.com/yihui-hu/y0p).

Inspired by the original [yop](https://fichtre.net/yop).
